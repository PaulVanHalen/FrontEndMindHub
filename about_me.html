        <p>The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes
            residing Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to
            learn and play hockey. To be a member of MDHL, you must be between the
            ages of 4 - 12 and reside a Chicago northside neighborhood. MDHL ran by a

            parents and previous league members.
