      have an interest in learning and playing soccer, with opportunities to
      learn and practice skills related to the game of hockey, specifically
      those skills around team cooperation and good sportsmanship.
    </p>

    <p><b>Vision</b></p>

      mindful athletes through the building of character, self-discipline, and
      leadership.
    </p>

    <p><b>General Information</b></p>
    <p>
      The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes
      residing Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to
      learn and play hockey. To be a member of MDHL, you must be between the
      ages of 4 - 12 and reside a Chicago northside neighborhood. MDHL ran by a
      small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of
      parents and previous league members.
