                The Mighty Ducks Hockey League aspires to develop strong,
                well-rounded and mindful athletes through the building of
                character, self-discipline, and leadership.

            <p>
              The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide
              athletes residing Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment
              in which to learn and play hockey. To be a member of MDHL, you
              must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside a Chicago northside
              neighborhood. MDHL ran by a small full-time staff, and relies on
              the generous volunteer time of parents and previous league
              members.
